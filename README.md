# Excel Portfolio Project

This repository contains my MS Excel portfolio project, which I worked on during my Data Science and AI bootcamp with Atomcamp. The project involves analyzing sales trends, identifying key insights, and using various Excel functions to answer business-related questions.

## About the Project
The dataset in this project contains sales data, and I have used Excel formulas, PivotTables, charts, and conditional formatting to answer different business-related questions.

## Files in this Repository
- **Excel-Portfolio-Dataset-and-Analysis.xlsx** – Contains the dataset along with all calculations, tables, graphs, and formula-based responses.
- **Excel-Portfolio-Questions-and-Responses.docx** – Includes the project questions and my written responses to text-based queries.

## Analysis Performed
1. **Sales & Profit Analysis:**
   - Identified total profit for each category and sub-category.
   - Found total sales for each product and highlighted the top-selling one.
   - Determined the city with the highest sales and the most common shipping mode.

2. **Customer & Segment Insights:**
   - Counted unique customers.
   - Used PivotTables to find top 3 customers based on purchases.
   - Created a Pivot Chart to visualize sales by Segment with Region and Ship Mode slicers.
   - Calculated the percentage of customers in each segment.

3. **Regional Analysis:**
   - Used FILTER function to find sales per state and identified states with sales over $100,000.
   - Created a PivotTable showing sales by region and category.
   - Calculated the average sales value per order in each region.
   - Used SUMIF to determine the percentage of total sales from each region.

4. **Revenue Drivers:**
   - Used conditional formatting to highlight high-value orders.
   - Created a category-wise sales breakdown for the top 5 order IDs.
   - Used COUNTIFS to analyze how many orders fall into different sales ranges.
